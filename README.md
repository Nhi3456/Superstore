## Recommendation
- Expand tailored marketing (bulk discounts, loyalty programs or premium services,...) for Corporate and Home Office.
- Possibly downgrade on marketing and logistics investment in West and East (these regions were proven profit centers).
- Renegotiate supplier costs, adjust prices, or drop unprofitable SKUs in Furniture category (especially Tables and Bookcases).
- Investigate why margins in Central and Sounth regions were weaker. Conduct a detailed review of operations and pricing strategies in these states (Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania). Investigate potential issues such as high shipping costs, aggressive discounting, or high return rate.
